## 🌟 About This Repository

This repository contains my **chapter-wise notes, explanations, and personal insights** while studying the book:

> **AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models** — *Chip Huyen*

Rather than just summarizing, I focus on:
- Breaking down complex ideas into simple intuition  
- Connecting theory with real-world AI systems  
- Adding reflections as a junior AI engineer and researcher  
- Making the content beginner-friendly and practical  

This is part of my journey to deeply understand how modern AI systems are built — not just how to use them.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

✔️ Clear explanations of key concepts  
✔️ Section-wise breakdowns of each chapter  
✔️ Intuition behind math, architectures, and training methods  
✔️ My personal insights and reflections  
✔️ Diagrams and tables (where helpful)  
✔️ Practical perspective for builders  

---

## 📚 Chapters Covered

### 📘 Chapter 1 — *Introduction to AI Engineering*
Key themes:
- Why **scale** defines modern AI  
- Rise of **AI engineering** as a discipline  
- LLMs as next-token predictors  
- From language models to **foundation models**  
- Prompting, RAG, and fine-tuning as core tools  
- AI systems vs demos  

💡 *Insight:*  
> AI engineering is about turning powerful models into **reliable systems** that solve real problems.

---

### 📘 Chapter 2 — *Understanding Foundation Models*
Key themes:
- Training data and its impact on behavior  
- Transformers and the **attention mechanism**  
- Model size and scaling trade-offs  
- Post-training: **SFT, RLHF, DPO**  
- Sampling strategies: temperature, top-k, top-p  
- Test-time compute and structured outputs  
- The **probabilistic nature** of AI  

💡 *Insight:*  
> What feels like magic is really matrix math, attention, and representations working at scale.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I am documenting my learning in public to:
- Build strong fundamentals in AI/LLMs  
- Practice thinking like a system designer, not just a model user  
- Help other learners who feel overwhelmed by the AI space  
- Create a long-term knowledge base for myself and others  

If you’re starting your AI journey or transitioning into AI engineering, I hope these notes make the path clearer.
